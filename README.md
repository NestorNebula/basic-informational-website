# basic-informational-website

## Description

This project consists of a basic website with links.

The site has 4 pages, Index, About, Contact me and a 404 Page for when users tries to go to an inexistant page.

The website doesn't have any css and any original html content (except of the few lines in each page) as the main goal of this project was to use Node to handle the different requests.
